            <p class="description-summary">This branding project, completed for a class, focused on developing a company and giving it a complete visual identity. I created Yard Line, a store offering high-quality football gear and apparel designed to help players excel on and off the field. Competing with brands like Adidas, Nike, and Under Armour, Yard Line stands out through its in-store experienceâ€”a mock football field where customers can test products before purchase to ensure quality.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I designed the brand's identity mark, color palette, and applications across various touchpoints, including store cones, a delivery vehicle and uniforms. My goal was to create a modern, professional aesthetic that communicated quality and trust. This project strengthened my skills in brand development, multi-platform design, and the use of multiple design tools to bring a brand to life.</p>
